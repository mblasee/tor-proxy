# 1. SOCKS Proxy Port
# Listen for SOCKS5 connections on port 9050 on all network interfaces inside the container.
# 0.0.0.0 means other containers on the same Docker network can connect to it.
SOCKSPort 0.0.0.0:9050

# 2. Control Port
# This port is used to send commands to the Tor daemon (e.g., to request a new IP).
# 0.0.0.0 makes it accessible to other containers on the same Docker network.
ControlPort 0.0.0.0:9051

# 3. Hashed Control Password
# This is a hashed password for accessing the Control Port.
# The value you provided corresponds to the password "password".
# You can generate your own hash using: tor --hash-password "your_new_password"
HashedControlPassword <YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD>

# 4. Log to standard output
# This is essential for Docker so that 'docker logs' works correctly.
Log notice stdout

# 5. Data Directory
# Explicitly define where Tor stores its state. This path should match
# the one created and secured in your Dockerfile.
